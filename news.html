            <h3>GM Uzbekistan plans to launch new cars in the budget segment</h3>
            <p>
                GM Uzbekistan plans to launch production of new cars in the budget 
                segment in the coming years, said Rustam Kodirov, head of the strategic 
                planning, analytics and development department of Uzavtosanoat.
                <span class="dots">...</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="more">
                    “We have plans to produce budget cars. So far, unfortunately,
                    I cannot disclose this, because there are processes, there is an agreement 
                    on non-disclosure of information, ”Kodirov said.
                    <br><br>
                    According to him, in the next five years, the company expects that the main demand 
                    will fall on the budget segment of the car market.
                    <br><br>
                    “I can say with confidence that it will be completely new models and their production 
                    will begin in parallel with the whole world,” the company representative added.
                    <br><br>
                    He also said that the Asaka plant could begin assembling Chevrolet Trailblazer, 
                    Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Traverse cars by the end of 2019.
                    <br><br>
                    “If I'm not mistaken, somewhere in December, or at the beginning of next year, 
                    they will start [to produce]. Their volume will be very small. It is necessary 
                    to focus primarily on demand. It makes no sense to produce hundreds of thousands 
                    of Trailblazer that they won’t buy, ”Kodirov told reporters.

            <h3>GM Uzbekistan announces the start of production of three new models</h3>
            <p>
                GM Uzbekistan may launch production of Chevrolet Trailblazer, Chevrolet Equinox 
                and Chevrolet Traverse cars in December 2019, Rustam Kodirov, head of the strategic 
                planning, analytics and development department of Uzavtosanoat, said.

                    <br><br>
                    Recall that the new SUV models were presented to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on May 
                    17 in Andijan. GM Uzbekistan plans to bring the localization level of new models to 50%.
                    <br><br>
                    Earlier, the deputy board of Uzavtosanoat Aziz Shukurov announced the production of 
                    three new models on a global chassis since the beginning of 2021, as well as the 
                    organization of the coarse assembly of 2 types of SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) class 
                    cars from the third quarter of 2019.

            <h3>GM Uzbekistan offers Tracker at a discount of 16 million in interest-free installments for 2 years</h3>
            <p> 
                GM Uzbekistan congratulates everyone on Ramadan and offers Tracker Premier AT with a 2-year 
                interest-free installment plan with a discount of 16 million soums.
                <br><br>
                To do this, the buyer must pay an initial payment of 128 million soums, and the remaining 
                amount must be paid within 2 years.
                <span class="dots">...</span>
                <br><br>
                <span class="more">
                    In addition, taking into account the numerous offers received from buyers, 
                    the company also increased the number of cars that can be purchased in interest-free installments.
                    <br><br>

                    It should be noted that a buyer who buys a car in installments for 1 year pays out an insurance policy

                    <br><br>
                    Buying on favorable conditions Lacetti will be available until June 10, and Tracker Premier AT - until June 12.
