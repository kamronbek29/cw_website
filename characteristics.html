                    Chevrolet Spark is the result of the work of leading designers from different countries. 
                    The Spark, with its impressive two-tier radiator grill and sharp contours, will surely attract 
                    attention wherever it is. In addition, due to its compact size and maneuverability, Spark is 
                    able to "integrate" into any urban movement.
                    <br><br>
                    Spark's cabin is very spacious, which can accommodate a load of 170 liters, and when folding 
                    the rear seats in a ratio of 60:40, this space increases to 568 liters. Outside, the Chevrolet 
                    Spark looks very compact, but 5 people can easily accommodate in its spacious interior.
                    <br><br>
                    In the city it’s a compact and maneuverable car, on the highway it sensitively responds to all 
                    the driver’s commands, and most importantly - wherever you are, it’s just nice to drive. In short, 
                    the Chevrolet Spark is a new step in the automotive industry.
                    <br><br>
                    You did not expect this - the dashboard is in a motorcycle style! Moreover, the dashboard is 
                    positioned so that it can be easily captured by the eye, while it is very compact and easy to use. 
                    The analogue speedometer of the new Spark is complemented by a digital tachometer, which is 
                    highlighted in blue when the side lights are turned on. In addition to aesthetic benefits, 
                    expressive design should also bring practical benefits. Highly located taillights that not only 
                    look great, but also contribute to safety in low visibility conditions. The raised wheel arches 
                    help improve aerodynamics and reduce fuel consumption.

                    Chevrolet Gentra - this is the car whose appearance will not leave indifferent any car 
                    enthusiast. The right proportions, streamlined shapes, embossed lines harmoniously combine 
                    in this car, which has a respectable interior and exterior. Gentra comfortably accommodates 
                    5 people in a modern, sleek interior. The dashboard has a sense of proportion and a variety 
                    of options. The arrangement of the chrome-plated devices is carefully thought out. Its 
                    driving performance has been thoroughly tested and perfected.
                    <br><br>
                    The streamlined, modern body design of the Chevrolet Gentra is a merit of the famous Italian 
                    Pininfarina car studio. The 4-door Gentra with an elegant design and a spacious interior 
                    is not just a family sedan, it is a clear confirmation that a practical car does not 
                    require compromises. This is the embodiment of quality from and to, with a lot of additional 
                    features and excellent handling.
                    <br><br>
                    The appearance of the car was created by Italian experts, so it looks pretty impressive. 
                    The main feature of the model is smooth, rounded lines, thanks to which it seems much 
                    larger and more voluminous than it actually is. At the same time, the appearance and 
                    dynamics are noble inherent in cars of a more expensive class. All exterior details, 
                    starting with 15-inch wheels and ending with the original side glazing, are distinguished 
                    by quality and Italian sophistication.

                    Salon Chevrolet Malibu - one of the most spacious and comfortable in its class. Thanks to the 
                    large width of the body, Malibu offers more space for passengers and luggage. The design of 
                    the car uses special sound-absorbing materials; McPherson front struts and multi-link independent 
                    rear suspension, and the engine is located in a special insulated block, which prevents noise 
                    from entering the cabin. This is embodied in the silhouette of the car, resembling a coupe, 
                    and in every detail. You no longer have to spend time looking for a key in a bag or briefcase 
                    - since you can remotely open the car's doors and start the engine, just by pressing a button 
                    on the toolbar. This is standard equipment for the LTZ. The rigid Malibu body structure not 
                    only contributes to better handling, but also protects car passengers. Wide, comfortable seats 
                    and a spacious lounge with many storage compartments - all this creates a feeling of well-being. 
                    Sound-absorbing materials used in the design of the car, independent suspension and an insulated 
                    engine subframe make the interior of the new Malibu cozy and quiet.
